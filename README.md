## Introduction

This application uses Python and Artificial Vision to detect faces in video. It utilizes the OpenCV library for image processing and the Haar Cascade classifier for detection.

## Usage

1. Run the script
2. Select an image file
3. The application will display the image with bounding boxes around any detected faces

## Requirements

- Python 3
- OpenCV
- Face_recognition
- Numpy
- OS

## Installation
0. conda env create -n FaceFind --file environment.yml
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Install the required libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the script with `python main.py`

## Conclusion

This application demonstrates the capabilities of Python and Artificial Vision in detecting faces in images. It can be used as a starting point for more advanced projects in computer vision and image processing.
